### Testing

The goal of the testing for this project is to ensure that each function produces the correct and expected output based on known inputs. These known inputs are designed to be similar to what would be a normal input for the functions within the context of the project. These tests will be feature the standard "setup, execute, and assert" pattern of typical unit tests. One small note, the methods to be tested must be changed to public from private to be tested.
